# Hybrid CASA apps

In a lot of cases, CASA is used to deliver GOVUK-style services for capturing data from users.

However, it can also be used to form a smaller part of an overall ExpressJS application by mounting it as a sub-application.

See the ["barebones" example application](examples/barebones/app.js) for an example of mounting a CASA app under a parent ExpressJS app.
